### Introduction

This document shows how to connect TMC2209 drivers via UART to the older MKS GEN L v1.0 board. It also demonstrates how to connect the fifth E1 driver via UART. Additionally, the configuration for KLIPPER is provided.

### MKS modifications

There's a common wiring scheme for TMC drivers on this board, but I propose simplifying it by soldering resistors directly onto the board and connecting the drivers with a single wire. These resistors would be soldered on the reverse side of the board, on the AUX-2 connector. The resistor value should be 1 kÎ©.

Optionally, if you need to connect the E1 driver via UART, you'll need to solder two wires directly to the microcontroller, specifically to ports PD1 (44 pin) and PB6 (Pin 25). I used a small 3x4mm board to accommodate the resistor. The connection diagram is shown below.

 ### TMC2209 modifications

 For the drivers to work seamlessly with this board, you can bend 3 pins, or, as I did, cut them off completely.

### Klipper TMC2209 UART configuration

I'm using two independent motors for the Z axis, with the second motor connected to the E1 connector. You can find the pinout in the following [repository.](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/Klipper-for-MKS-Boards/tree/main/MKS%20Gen%20l)
